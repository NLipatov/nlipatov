I actively contribute to the open-source community. Here are some of my notable contributions:

- **[virtualize-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/virtualize-js)**: A JavaScript library that provides efficient DOM virtualization for web applications. It helps in rendering large lists and complex UI elements with minimal performance overhead.
  
- **[Ethachat](https://github.com/NLipatov/Ethachat)**: A Blazor WASM application I created with end-to-end encryption using RSA and AES. Ethachat allows for secure transmission of both text and binary files. It also supports streaming of video files using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming).
